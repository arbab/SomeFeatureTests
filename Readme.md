## TipKit

TipKit framework provides us to build custom rules is events. An event is a user action we can donate to. The main difference with the parameters is the persistence. Framework automatically stores the number of events that happened.

Define rules to control when a tip should be displayed
TipKit offers two ways to do this: based on Parameters and on Events.


### Tip, Rules, Events
Tip consists of a Image, Title, Message, Action
